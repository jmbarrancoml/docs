## Timeline of AI Development

Understanding the history of AI helps contextualize current breakthroughs and anticipate future developments.

## Pre-History: Foundational Ideas (Pre-1940s)

### Ancient Philosophical Foundations
- **Ancient Greece**: Aristotle's formal logic and reasoning systems
- **Medieval Period**: Al-Jazari's programmable automata (1206)
- **17th Century**: Leibniz's universal language concept

### Mathematical Precedents
- **1854**: George Boole develops Boolean algebra
- **1936**: Alan Turing introduces the Turing machine
- **1940**: Claude Shannon's information theory

## Birth of AI (1940s-1950s)

### The McCulloch-Pitts Neuron (1943)
Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts created the first mathematical model of an artificial neuron, establishing the foundation for neural networks.

```python
# Simplified McCulloch-Pitts neuron concept
def mcculloch_pitts_neuron(inputs, weights, threshold):
    weighted_sum = sum(w * x for w, x in zip(weights, inputs))
    return 1 if weighted_sum >= threshold else 0
```

### Key Milestones
- **1945**: John von Neumann describes self-replicating machines
- **1950**: Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence"
- **1951**: First neural network machine (SNARC) by Marvin Minsky
- **1956**: Dartmouth Conference - AI officially named as a field

### The Dartmouth Conference (1956)
Organized by John McCarthy, this workshop brought together:
- Marvin Minsky (MIT)
- Nathaniel Rochester (IBM)
- Claude Shannon (Bell Labs)

The proposal stated: *"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it."*

## Golden Age of AI (1956-1974)

### Early Achievements
- **1957**: Frank Rosenblatt develops the Perceptron
- **1958**: John McCarthy creates LISP programming language
- **1959**: Arthur Samuel coins "machine learning"
- **1961**: First industrial robot (Unimate) begins operation
- **1965**: ELIZA chatbot demonstrates natural language processing

### The Perceptron Algorithm
```python
# Perceptron learning rule
def perceptron_update(weights, inputs, target, prediction, learning_rate):
    error = target - prediction
    for i in range(len(weights)):
        weights[i] += learning_rate * error * inputs[i]
    return weights
```

### Optimistic Predictions
Early AI researchers made bold predictions:
- Herbert Simon (1957): "Within 10 years, computers will be world chess champions"
- Marvin Minsky (1967): "Within a generation, the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved"

## First AI Winter (1974-1980)

### Challenges and Limitations
- **Computational Limitations**: Limited processing power and memory
- **Combinatorial Explosion**: Problems scaled poorly
- **Perceptron Limitations**: Minsky & Papert's critique (1969)

### The XOR Problem
The perceptron couldn't solve linearly non-separable problems:

```python
# XOR function - not linearly separable
XOR_data = [
    ([0, 0], 0),
    ([0, 1], 1),
    ([1, 0], 1),
    ([1, 1], 0)
]
```

### Funding Cuts
- DARPA reduces AI funding significantly
- UK's Lighthill Report criticizes AI progress
- Research focus shifts to specific applications

## Expert Systems Era (1980-1987)

### Knowledge-Based Systems
- **MYCIN (1976)**: Medical diagnosis expert system
- **DENDRAL (1965-1995)**: Chemical analysis system
- **XCON/R1 (1982)**: Computer configuration system

### Knowledge Representation
```lisp
; Example expert system rule in CLIPS
(defrule high-fever-rule
   (patient (name ?name) (temperature ?temp&:(> ?temp 101)))
   =>
   (assert (diagnosis ?name "possible infection"))
   (printout t "Patient " ?name " has high fever" crlf))
```

### Commercial Success
- Expert systems market reaches $2 billion by 1988
- Companies like Symbolics and Lisp Machines Inc. flourish
- Universities establish AI departments

## Second AI Winter (1987-1993)

### Market Collapse
- Expert systems prove brittle and expensive to maintain
- Competition from cheaper desktop computers
- Lisp machine companies fail

### Limitations Exposed
- **Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck**: Difficult to capture expert knowledge
- **Brittleness**: Systems failed outside narrow domains
- **Maintenance Problems**: Rule bases became unwieldy

## Machine Learning Renaissance (1990s-2000s)

### Statistical Approaches
- Focus shifts from symbolic to statistical methods
- **Support Vector Machines** (1995): Vapnik introduces SVMs
- **Random Forests** (2001): Ensemble methods gain popularity
- **Kernel Methods**: Non-linear transformations through kernels

### Key Algorithms
```python
# Support Vector Machine concept
def svm_decision_function(x, support_vectors, alphas, kernel_func):
    decision_value = 0
    for i, sv in enumerate(support_vectors):
        decision_value += alphas[i] * kernel_func(x, sv)
    return decision_value
```

    scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1))
    attention_weights = torch.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, value)
