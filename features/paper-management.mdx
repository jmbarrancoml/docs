## Adding papers

Freiya supports three methods for adding papers to your library. Choose the one that works best for your workflow.

### Method 1: Search by DOI

The fastest and most accurate way to add papers with complete metadata.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Paper">
    Find the **Add Paper** button in the top-right corner of your library
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select DOI tab">
    The DOI search tab is usually selected by default
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the DOI">
    Paste the DOI (e.g., `10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fetch metadata">
    Click **Search** and Freiya automatically retrieves all paper information
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and save">
    Verify the information and click **Save to Library**
  </Step>
</Steps>

  <img src="https://placehold.co/1000x600/4F46E5/white?text=Add+Paper+modal" alt="Add Paper modal with the DOI tab selected, showing the DOI input field with an example DOI entered, " />
</Frame>

<Tip>
Find DOIs on journal websites, in paper PDFs (usually in the header or footer), or on Google Scholar.
</Tip>

**What gets fetched:**
- Title and abstract
- Complete author list with affiliations
- Publication venue and year
- Citation count
- DOI and URL links
- PDF URL (when available via open access)
- Institution information

**Data sources:**
- Semantic Scholar API (primary)
- CrossRef API (backup)
- OpenAlex (institutions)

### Method 2: Manual entry

Perfect for papers without DOIs, preprints, or when you need to customize metadata.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Add Paper">
    Click **Add Paper** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Manual Entry tab">
    Switch to the **Manual Entry** tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in details">
    Enter the paper information:
    - Title (required)
    - Authors
    - Publication name
    - Year
    - Abstract
    - DOI (optional)
    - URL (optional)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add tags">
    Optionally add tags for organization
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save to Library**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://placehold.co/1000x600/4F46E5/white?text=Add+Paper+modal" alt="Add Paper modal showing the Manual Entry tab with form fields for title, authors, publication, year," />
</Frame>

<Note>
Manual entry is great for working papers, dissertations, technical reports, or historical papers that don't have DOIs.
</Note>

### Method 3: PDF upload

Upload a PDF and let Freiya extract metadata automatically.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Add Paper">
    Click **Add Paper** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select PDF Upload tab">
    Switch to the **Upload PDF** tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose file">
    Click **Browse** and select a PDF from your device
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for processing">
    Freiya extracts text and metadata from the PDF
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and edit">
    Verify the extracted information and make any corrections
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save to Library**
  </Step>
</Steps>

**File size limits:**
- Free tier: 10 MB
- Pro tier: 50 MB
- Nova tier: 100 MB
