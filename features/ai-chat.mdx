Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
in the context of medical image analysis.

Summarize the key findings from the paper "Attention Is All You Need"
and explain why the transformer architecture was revolutionary.

What are the main limitations of this methodology, and how might
I address them in my research design?
```

**Less effective prompts:**
```
Tell me about machine learning
What's this paper about?
Help with research
```

## Usage tracking

Freiya tracks your AI usage to ensure fair access and manage costs. Each model type has separate limits.

### How usage works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monthly allocation">
    Your tier determines how many messages you get per model type each month
  </Step>

  <Step title="Per-message deduction">
    Each message you send consumes one message credit for that model
  </Step>

  <Step title="Real-time tracking">
    See your remaining messages for each model in the interface
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monthly reset">
    All limits reset on the 1st of each month
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://placehold.co/1000x600/4F46E5/white?text=Usage+indicator+showing" alt="Usage indicator showing message count like "42/100 messages remaining this month" with a small progr" />

### Effective prompting tips

1. **Start with context** - Explain what you're working on
2. **Be specific** - Ask precise questions rather than broad ones
3. **Request format** - Specify if you want lists, paragraphs, or tables
4. **Provide examples** - Show the AI what you're looking for
5. **Follow up** - Build on previous responses with clarifying questions

**Example progressive conversation:**
```
You: I'm researching neural network optimization for medical imaging.

You: What are the current state-of-the-art optimization algorithms
used in this field?

AI: [Provides response about Adam, RMSprop, etc.]

You: Can you compare Adam and RMSprop specifically for small
medical imaging datasets (< 1000 samples)?

AI: [Provides detailed comparison]

You: What would be the best approach for my dataset of 500
chest X-rays?
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I ran out of messages for my model">
    You have three options:
    1. Wait until the 1st of next month for your reset
    2. Switch to a different model type
    3. Upgrade your tier for higher limits
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The AI response seems incorrect">
    AI models can make mistakes. Always:
    - Verify against source materials
    - Cross-check important facts
    - Ask for clarification or sources
    - Use multiple models for important queries
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My chat history disappeared">
    Chats are saved automatically, but:
    - Check if you're logged into the correct account
    - Look in the "All Chats" view, not just "Recent"
    - Check if you accidentally deleted it
    - Contact support if the issue persists
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The response stopped mid-sentence">
    This can happen due to:
    - Token limits on the model
    - Network interruption
    - Click "Regenerate" to try again
    - Or ask the AI to continue with "Please continue"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the AI for writing my papers?">
    You can use AI as a research assistant, but:
    - Always write in your own words
    - Use AI for brainstorming and understanding
    - Cite sources properly, not the AI
    - Check your institution's AI usage policies
    - Never submit AI-generated text as your own work
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
