EderSpark is a technology startup based in Córdoba, Spain, founded as a **Sociedad Limitada (SL)** on 13 July 2025. The company is co-led by a CTO and CEO team, both experienced in AI, astrophysics, and software engineering. EderSpark works at the intersection of artificial intelligence and scientific research. The team consists of researchers and developers engaged in European research initiatives (e.g., Horizon Europe) and maintains strong links with academic and industrial partners.

## Vision

To **accelerate scientific discovery** by making advanced AI tools accessible and reliable for researchers worldwide. EderSpark aims to remove technical barriers in knowledge discovery, enabling scientists to extract insights directly from vast scientific literature and data. The long-term vision is a trusted AI copilot that provides **organic, cited, and referenced answers** grounded in peer-reviewed research.

## Products  

### 1. Scientific Copilot Platform: Freiya

- **Core Functionality**:  
  - Performs **semantic search** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** over **200+ million** scientific articles from sources like Semantic Scholar.  
  - Embeds and indexes articles in a **QDrant** cloud database for high-speed querying.  
  - Generates answers supported by citations and references, ensuring scientific rigor.  
  - Supports researchers in refining queries and iteratively exploring topics.  
  - Backend built with **FastAPI** for performance and scalability, optimized for high concurrency.  
  - Frontend built in **React** with Material-UI (MUI) and Tailwind CSS for a clean, usable interface.

- **Additional Capabilities**:  
  - Handles query parsing, splitting, embedding, and response generation efficiently to minimize RAM usage and latency.
