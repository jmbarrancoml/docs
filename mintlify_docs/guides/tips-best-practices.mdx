Master Freiya with these tips, tricks, and best practices from experienced users. Whether you're new to the platform or looking to level up your workflow, you'll find actionable advice here.

## Organization strategies

### Start with structure

Set up your organizational system before adding many papers:

**Day one checklist:**
<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your collections">
    Create 2-4 core collections based on your projects or topics
  </Step>

  <Step title="Establish tag system">
    Decide on your tagging conventions (see recommendations below)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create templates">
    Write a note template for consistent paper summaries
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up color code">
    Decide what each highlight color means for you
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The 10 minutes you spend setting up organization will save hours later.
</Tip>

### The "Three-Tag Rule"

Every paper should have at least three tags:

1. **Status tag** - Reading progress (`to-read`, `reading`, `read`)
2. **Importance tag** - Priority level (`key-paper`, `supporting`, `reference`)
3. **Topic tag** - Subject area (`methodology`, `theory`, `application`)

**Example:**
A paper might be tagged: `reading`, `key-paper`, `neural-networks`

This system ensures papers are both findable and prioritized.

### Collection naming patterns

Use consistent, descriptive names that scale:

✅ **Good patterns:**
```
Project-based:
- "Thesis - Ch1 - Introduction"
- "Thesis - Ch2 - Literature Review"
- "Grant Proposal - NSF 2025"

Topic-based:
- "ML - Deep Learning"
- "ML - Computer Vision"
- "ML - NLP"

Course-based:
- "CS601 - Machine Learning"
- "Seminar - Fall 2024"
```

❌ **Avoid:**
```
- "Papers"
- "Stuff"
- "Collection 1"
- "Temp"
- "Misc"
```

## Reading efficiently

### The three-pass method

Don't try to read every paper deeply. Use this approach:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pass 1: Screening (5 min)">
    **Goal:** Decide if worth reading

    - Read title and abstract
    - Look at figures and captions
    - Check references (any familiar?)
    - Skim conclusions

    **Decision:** Keep, maybe, or discard
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Pass 2: Overview (30 min)">
    **Goal:** Understand main points

    - Read introduction and conclusions carefully
    - Read section headings
    - Study figures and tables
    - Highlight key findings (yellow)

    **Outcome:** Can explain paper's contribution
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Pass 3: Deep dive (1-2 hours)">
    **Goal:** Master the details

    - Read thoroughly, front to back
    - Understand methodology (green highlights)
    - Verify claims and logic
    - Note limitations (red highlights)
    - Write detailed summary

    **Outcome:** Could reproduce or critique the work
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Only about 20% of papers deserve a third pass. Be selective with your time.
</Note>

### Active reading techniques

**While reading, actively engage:**

- **Question everything** - Don't accept claims blindly
- **Make predictions** - Guess results before reading them
- **Connect ideas** - Link to other papers you've read
- **Visualize** - Draw diagrams of concepts
- **Summarize sections** - Pause and recap in your own words

**In Freiya:**
- Add comments with your questions
- Use purple highlights for "to investigate"
- Link related papers in notes
- Draw on PDFs (coming soon)
- Write section summaries in comments

### Speed reading papers

**Techniques for faster reading:**

1. **Read abstract first** - Sets context for everything else
2. **Study visuals** - Figures often tell the whole story
3. **Skip intro on first read** - Usually literature review you know
4. **Read results before methods** - Understand what before how
5. **Save background for later** - Deep dive only when needed

<Tip>
Don't feel guilty about skimming. Your goal is understanding, not word-by-word reading.
</Tip>

## Annotation strategies

### Develop a personal system

**Example highlighting system:**

| What I Highlight | Color | Why |
|------------------|-------|-----|
| Core argument | Yellow | The paper's main claim |
| Evidence | Green | Data supporting the claim |
| Quotable passages | Blue | For citing in my writing |
| Problems/limitations | Red | Weaknesses to discuss |
| My ideas | Purple | Thoughts sparked by reading |
| Examples | Orange | Useful illustrations |

**Stick to your system!** Consistency makes review much easier.

### Comment like you're teaching

Write comments as if explaining to someone else:

**Instead of:** "Important"
**Write:** "This shows that X causes Y, which contradicts Smith's finding. Possible confound: Z wasn't controlled."

**Instead of:** "Good method"
**Write:** "Their use of repeated measures eliminates between-subject variance. Could adapt this for my study."

Future you will appreciate the context.

### Use categorization

Beyond colors, categorize highlights:

- **Methodology** - How they did it
- **Results** - What they found
- **Discussion** - What it means
- **Limitations** - What's problematic
- **Future work** - What's next

Filter by category when reviewing for specific purposes.

## AI chat best practices

### Prompt engineering tips

**Be specific:**

❌ "Tell me about this paper"
✅ "Summarize the three main findings from the Results section and explain their statistical significance"

❌ "How does this work?"
✅ "Explain how their attention mechanism differs from standard self-attention, and why they claim it's more efficient"

**Provide context:**

Instead of:
"What are the limitations?"

Try:
"I'm writing a literature review on medical imaging. What are the main limitations of this approach that I should mention, particularly regarding generalization to different populations?"

### Iterative questioning

Build on previous responses:

```
You: What methodology did the authors use?

AI: [Explains methodology]

You: What are the advantages of this approach over traditional methods?

AI: [Explains advantages]

You: Given those advantages, why might they have still seen the limitations mentioned in the Discussion?

AI: [Deeper analysis]
```

This conversational approach often yields better insights than single questions.

### Verify AI responses

<Warning>
Always verify AI-provided information:
</Warning>

- **Cross-check facts** against the actual paper
- **Verify citations** in the original source
- **Consult experts** for critical decisions
- **Use multiple sources** for important claims
- **Never cite the AI** - cite the original paper

AI is a research assistant, not a replacement for critical thinking.

## Search and discovery

### Advanced search techniques

**Use specific terms:**
- DOI searches for exact papers
- Author name + topic
- Methodology-specific terms
- Year ranges for recent work

**Google Scholar tips:**
- Use quotes for exact phrases: `"attention mechanism"`
- Exclude terms with minus: `-review` (exclude reviews)
- Site-specific: `site:arxiv.org`
- Date ranges: Tools → Custom range

**In Freiya:**
- Search within collections
- Filter by tags first, then search
- Use autocomplete suggestions
- Try alternative terms if no results

### Building your library

**Quality over quantity:**

- Don't add papers you'll never read
- Be selective in your criteria
- Delete papers that turn out irrelevant
- Aim for a curated, useful library

**Growth strategies:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Focused approach">
    **Weekly additions: 2-5 papers**
    - Deep engagement with each
    - Thorough notes and highlights
    - Complete reading before adding more

    **Best for:** Deep expertise in narrow area
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Broad approach">
    **Weekly additions: 10-20 papers**
    - Skim most, deep-read few
    - Light tagging and notes
    - Periodic review and pruning

    **Best for:** Interdisciplinary work, staying current
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Project approach">
    **Add in batches per project**
    - Literature review: 50-100 papers
    - Background reading: 20-30 papers
    - Methodology refs: 10-15 papers

    **Best for:** Specific research projects
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Productivity hacks

### Keyboard shortcuts mastery

Learn these essentials:

| Task | Shortcut | Time Saved |
|------|----------|------------|
| New chat | `Ctrl/Cmd + N` | 3 seconds |
| Add paper | `Ctrl/Cmd + P` | 2 seconds |
| Search library | `Ctrl/Cmd + F` | 2 seconds |
| Quick command | `Ctrl/Cmd + K` | 3 seconds |

**Do the math:**
Using shortcuts 20 times/day × 2.5 seconds = 50 seconds/day = 300 hours/year saved!

[See all shortcuts →](/reference/keyboard-shortcuts)

### Batch similar tasks

Instead of: Add paper → tag → add notes → repeat

Try: Add 5 papers → tag all 5 → write notes for all 5

**Batch operations save mental switching costs:**
- Add papers in one session
- Tag papers in another
- Review and annotate in a third
- Weekly note-writing session

### Time blocking

**Sample research schedule:**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Mon 9-10am | Paper discovery and addition |
| Mon 2-3pm | Deep reading (Pass 3) |
| Wed 9-11am | Annotation and note-taking |
| Fri 3-4pm | Weekly organization and planning |

Consistent routines build momentum and reduce decision fatigue.

## Collaboration tips

### Sharing effectively

**When sharing chats:**
- Remove sensitive or unpublished information
- Add context at the top
- Check that it makes sense standalone
- Include relevant paper links

**When sharing paper lists:**
- Export with notes/tags
- Add a README explaining organization
- Include citation file (BibTeX)
- Note any access restrictions

### Team coordination

**For research groups:**

1. **Standardize tagging** - Agree on tag conventions
2. **Shared naming** - Consistent collection/paper naming
3. **Regular sync** - Weekly coordination meetings
