    Jot down why it's relevant (one sentence)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continue or deep-dive">
    Move on or read more based on relevance
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Set aside dedicated time each week for paper discovery. Consistency beats marathon sessions.
</Tip>

## Phase 2: Organization

### Collection structure

Create a logical hierarchy for your research:

**Example structure:**
```
Paper Collections:
├── Project: Thesis
│   ├── Ch1 - Introduction
│   ├── Ch2 - Literature Review
│   ├── Ch3 - Methodology
│   └── Ch4 - Results
├── Background Reading
│   ├── Foundational Papers
│   └── Recent Reviews
├── Methodology References
└── Papers to Cite

Chat Collections:
├── Thesis Brainstorming
├── Methodology Questions
└── Paper Analysis
```

++IMAGE: **Screenshot of collections sidebar showing a hierarchical organization of paper collections as described above**++

### Tagging system

Develop a consistent tagging strategy:

**Multi-dimensional tags:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Status tags">
    Track reading progress:
    - `to-read` - Haven't read yet
    - `reading` - Currently reading
    - `read` - Finished reading
    - `review-needed` - Need to re-read
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Importance tags">
    Prioritize papers:
    - `key-paper` - Essential to your work
    - `foundational` - Important background
    - `supporting` - Supplementary material
    - `to-cite` - Plan to reference
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Topic tags">
    Categorize by content:
    - `methodology` - Method-focused
    - `theory` - Theoretical work
    - `application` - Applied research
    - `review` - Review papers
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Custom tags">
    Field-specific or project tags:
    - Your research areas
    - Specific techniques
    - Data types
    - Populations studied
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Use lowercase with hyphens for consistency. Decide on your system early and stick to it.
</Note>

### Weekly organization routine

**Sunday prep (15 minutes):**
1. Review papers added this week
2. Verify tags are applied
3. Move to appropriate collections
4. Update reading priorities
5. Plan next week's reading

## Phase 3: Reading and annotation

### Deep reading workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Focus session">
    Open paper in Focus mode
  </Step>

  <Step title="First pass - skim">
    - Abstract and conclusions
    - Figures and tables
    - Section headings
    - Highlight key points (yellow)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Second pass - detailed">
    - Read introduction thoroughly
    - Understand methodology (green highlights)
    - Analyze results
    - Add comments to highlights
  </Step>

  <Step title="Third pass - critical">
    - Evaluate arguments
    - Note limitations (red highlights)
    - Identify questions (purple highlights)
    - Consider applications
  </Step>

  <Step title="Summarize">
    Write summary in paper notes
  </Step>
</Steps>

++IMAGE: **PDF in Focus mode showing highlights in different colors according to the reading workflow stages**++

### Annotation best practices

**Color coding strategy:**

| Phase | Color | What to Highlight |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **Skim** | Yellow | Key findings, main claims |
| **Detailed** | Green | Methodology, approach details |
| **Analysis** | Blue | Important quotes for citations |
| **Critical** | Red | Limitations, concerns |
| **Synthesis** | Purple | Questions, future work, connections |
| **Examples** | Orange | Useful examples, case studies |

**Comment guidelines:**
- **Summaries** - Paraphrase in your own words
- **Questions** - Note what's unclear
- **Connections** - Link to other papers
- **Applications** - How it applies to your work
- **Criticisms** - Evaluate strengths and weaknesses

<Tip>
Add emojis for quick visual scanning: 💡 insights, ❓ questions, ⭐ very important, 🚨 critical
</Tip>

### Note-taking template

Use this structure in paper notes:

```markdown
# Quick Summary
[One paragraph summary in your own words]

# Key Findings
- Finding 1

- Finding 3

# Methodology
[Brief description of methods used]

# Strengths
- What this paper does well

# Limitations

    Explain the authors' main argument in simple terms.

    What assumptions underlie their methodology?

    How does this work relate to [other paper]?
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Critique">
    ```
    What are potential weaknesses in their approach?

    What alternative explanations weren't considered?

    How might these findings be limited by [factor]?
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Synthesis">
    ```
    Compare the methodology in this paper to [Paper B].

    How do these findings complement [other research]?

    What gaps remain in the literature after this work?
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Application">
    ```
    How could I adapt this methodology for [my context]?

    What would need to change to apply this to [domain]?

    What tools or resources would I need to replicate this?
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Literature matrix

Create a comparison table (use external spreadsheet or document):

### Writing with AI assistance

**Ethical AI use for writing:**

<Check>
✅ **Use AI to:**
- Explain concepts you're reading
- Brainstorm connections between ideas
- Understand difficult passages
- Explore alternative phrasings
- Check logical flow
</Check>

<Danger>
❌ **Don't use AI to:**
- Write your paper for you
- Generate text to submit as yours
- Replace actual reading and thinking
- Avoid understanding source material
- Bypass proper citation
</Danger>

**Best practices:**
1. Always write in your own words
2. Cite original sources, not AI
3. Use AI as a tutor, not a ghostwriter
4. Check institutional policies on AI use
5. Be transparent about AI usage if required

## Common pitfalls

<Warning>
**Avoid these workflow mistakes:**
</Warning>

1. **Over-collecting** - Adding papers you'll never read
2. **Under-tagging** - Not organizing as you go
3. **Inconsistent highlighting** - Random color usage
4. **Skipping summaries** - Not writing notes while reading
5. **No backups** - Failing to export your work
6. **Perfectionism** - Spending too long organizing vs. reading
7. **Ignoring review** - Not revisiting and refining annotations

## Customization ideas

Adapt these workflows to your style:

**For theory-heavy research:**
- Add "framework" tag for conceptual papers
- Create "theory" vs "empirical" collections
- Use more detailed note templates
- AI chats for concept clarification

**For empirical research:**
- Tag by methodology type
- Create data/methods collections
- Highlight statistical details
- Note replication considerations

**For interdisciplinary work:**
- Multiple field-specific tag sets
- Cross-disciplinary comparison collections
- "Bridge papers" that connect fields
- AI to explain unfamiliar terminology

## Tools integration

**Freiya plays well with:**
- **Reference managers** - Export to Zotero, Mendeley
- **Note apps** - Export markdown to Obsidian, Notion
