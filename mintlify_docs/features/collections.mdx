Collections help you organize your research materials into logical groups. Whether you're managing a thesis, conducting a literature review, or juggling multiple projects, collections keep everything organized and accessible.

++IMAGE: **Collections overview page showing multiple colorful collection cards, each displaying collection name, description, paper/chat count, and color coding**++

## Overview

Freiya supports two types of collections:
- **Paper collections** - Group related research papers
- **Chat collections** - Organize AI conversations

Both work similarly but serve different organizational needs in your research workflow.

<Info>
Collection limits depend on your subscription tier: Free (2), Pro/Nova (20), Unlimited (no limit).
</Info>

## Paper collections

Paper collections help you organize your research library by topic, project, course, or any custom category that makes sense for your work.

### Creating paper collections

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Collections">
    Click **Collections** in the sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click New Collection">
    Find and click the **New Paper Collection** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter details">
    Fill in the collection information:
    - **Name** (required) - e.g., "Thesis Chapter 2"
    - **Description** (optional) - What this collection contains
    - **Color** (optional) - Choose a color for visual organization
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create">
    Click **Create** to save your new collection
  </Step>
</Steps>

++IMAGE: **"Create Collection" modal showing input fields for name, description, and a color picker with preset color options**++

<Tip>
Choose descriptive names that will still make sense months from now. "Thesis Ch2 - ML Healthcare" is better than "Current Reading".

- Thesis - Chapter 3 (Methodology)
- Grant Proposal - NSF 2025
- Conference Paper - ICML

Chat Collections:
- Thesis Brainstorming

- Paper Analysis Chats
```

### By topic

Group by research areas or subjects:

**Example structure:**
```
Paper Collections:
- Machine Learning - Theory
- Machine Learning - Applications
- Neural Networks - Architectures
- Medical Imaging
- Ethics in AI

Chat Collections:
- ML Theory Questions
- Implementation Help
- Paper Discussions
```

### By status

Track reading and work status:

**Example structure:**
```
Paper Collections:

Chat Collections:
- Active Discussions

```

### By course or semester

Academic organization:

**Example structure:**
```

```

<Tip>
Mix strategies! Use both topic-based and project-based collections for maximum flexibility.
</Tip>

## Color coding

Collections support custom colors for visual organization.

### Choosing colors

**Common color schemes:**
- **Project importance** - Red (critical), Yellow (important), Green (reference)
- **By field** - Blue (CS), Green (bio), Purple (physics)
- **By status** - Gray (to-do), Yellow (active), Green (complete)
- **By term** - Different color per semester

### Collection naming tips

**Good names:**
- "Thesis - Ch2 - Literature Review"
- "Grant Proposal NSF 2025 - Background"
- "ML Paper Reading List - Fall 2024"
- "Key Methodology Papers"

**Less effective names:**
- "Papers"
- "Stuff to Read"
- "Collection 1"
- "Temp"

### When to create a new collection

Create a new collection when:
- Starting a new project or paper
- Beginning a new course
- Exploring a new research area
- Needing to separate concerns
- Current collections are getting too large (>50 papers)

### When to consolidate

Merge or delete collections when:
- Very similar purposes
- Inactive projects
- Approaching tier limit
- Too many small collections
- Collections have fewer than 5 items

## Integration with other features

    Papers can belong to multiple collections simultaneously:
    1. Remove from one collection if desired
    2. Add to new collection
    3. Paper exists in both places

    There's no "move" because papers aren't limited to one collection.

    Collection names must be unique per user. Options:
    - Choose a different name
    - Add differentiating details (dates, projects)
    - Delete the old collection if no longer needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Papers disappeared from collection">
    Check if:
    - You removed them accidentally

    - You're viewing the correct collection
    - Filters are hiding papers
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export a collection?">
    Yes! Export options:
    - Export all citations from collection
    - Download paper list as CSV
    - Generate bibliography for collection
